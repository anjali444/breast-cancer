  <p>My name is Anjali Jayan and I am the creator of this website. I would like to thank my family, especially my mom, for inspiring my passion about medicine. She is an oncologist who is always devoted to her amiable patients. I am also dedicating my website to my mother's patients because breast cancer is an issue that needs to be more aware to the public.  Furthermore, I want to acknowledge Girls Who Code and their staff for helping me whenever I needed assistance in code. They have taught me numerous computer coding languages, while making the coding class an entertaining experience. Thank you for all of the support. Lastly, I want dedicate my creation to ther breast cancer websites that have helped my understanding of breast cancer. American Cancer Society, Susan G Komen, National Breast Cancer Foundation, and BreastCancer.org provided me fascinating facts about the science of breast cancer.
