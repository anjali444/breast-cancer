  <p>Breast cancer is an abnominal growth in cells in the breast, which can affect both females and males. These cells grow ut of control and can spread to other parts of the body. This can make the body's functions increasingly difficult to perform. If left untreated, breast cancer can kill a man or woman. According to nationalbreastcancer.org, "In 2018, an estimated 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 63,960 new cases of non-invasive breast cancer." Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer will spread if left untreated. Being aware of breast cancer, early diagnosis and treatment are the important measures in fighting breast cancer.</p>

<p>Breast Cancer starts to develop when the cell growth in tissue starts to go wrong. This would result in masses of tissue emerging together, creating a tumor (a lump). A tumor would either be benign or malignant. Benign tumors are not cancerous, yet malignant is and can begin metastasis, spreading cancer cells to other parts of the body.</p>
  
  <p>There is five stages in breast cancer. The first stage is 0, which means it's invasive. The cancer is localized on the milk ducts. Stage 1 is when it has not spreaded completely to the lymph nodes, but the cancer is perceptable in a contained area. Stage 2 is separated into 2A and 2B (categorized by the size of tumor). This is wehn it is still suppressed in the breast, yet it is still developing. Stage 3 is also divided into groups, but it generally has spreaded past the tumor. Stage 4 is when the breast cancer has spreaded to other organs in the body.
