  <p>Chemoprevention is the process of taking medication to lower the risk of breast cancer. Women who take drugs to prevent breast cancer should have a high chance of of getting this disease. They need to consider their risk factors, like being a woman, getting older, family history, menstrual history, pregnancy history, smoking, having invasive breast cancer in the past, and having a gene mutation related to breast cancer. Side effects should be observed while taking medication. 
  </p>

<p> Diagnosis will take place when a lump is presented in the breast or an abnormality is shown from a mammogram. Follow up tests would follow after to determine whether breast cancer is present or not. Follow up tests would consist of a needle or surgical biopsy. From the biopsy, pathologists would examine the cells under a microscope and diagnose breast cancer or state that there is no evidence. It is important to remember that most breast biopsies do not show breast cancer. If there is breast cancer, doctors will help you fight off the disease with some treatment options.
